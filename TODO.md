# TODO

## aquatic_ws
* tests
* ipv4 and ipv6 state split: think about this more..

## aquatic_udp
* mio: set oneshot for epoll and kqueue? otherwise, stop reregistering?
* handle errors similarily to aquatic_ws, including errors in socket workers
* Handle Ipv4 and Ipv6 peers. Probably split torrent state. Ipv4 peers
  can't make use of Ipv6 ones. Ipv6 ones may or may note be able to make
  use of Ipv4 ones, I have to check.
* More tests?
* Add ctrl-c handler (exit)

## aquatic_udp_protocol
* Tests with good known byte sequences (requests and responses)

# Not important

## aquatic_ws
* config
  * send/recv buffer size?
  * tcp backlog?
  * some config.network fields are actually used in handler. maybe they should
    be checked while parsing? not completely clear
* "close connection" message from handler on peer_id and socket_addr mismatch?
  Probably not really necessary. If it is an honest mistake, peer will just
  keep announcing and after a few minutes, the peer in the map will be cleaned
  out and everything will start working
* stack-allocated vectors for announce request offers and scrape request info
  hashes?
* write new version of extract_response_peers which checks for equality with
  peer sending request? It could return an arrayvec or smallvec by the way
  (but then the size needs to be adjusted together with the corresponding
  config var, or the config var needs to be removed)

## aquatic_udp

* Does it really make sense to include peer address in peer map key? I have
  to think about why I included it in the first place.
* if socket workers panic while binding, don't sit around and wait for them
  in privdrop function. Maybe wait some maximum amount of time?
* No overflow on instant + duration arithmetic now, hopefully? Possibly,
  checked_add should be used.
* extract_response_peers
    * Cleaner code
    * Stack-allocated vector?
* Use log crate for errors, including logging thread names? I could probably
  use code from old rs_news project for that.
* Performance
    * cpu-target=native good?
    * mialloc good?
    * Try using flume (MPSC) or multiqueue2 (MPMC) instead of crossbeam channel

## aquatic_udp_protocol
* Avoid heap allocation in general if it can be avoided?
    * request from bytes for scrape: use arrayvec with some max size for
      torrents? With Vec, allocation takes quite a bit of CPU time
    * Optimize bytes to scrape request: Vec::with_capacity or other solution (SmallVec?)
* Don't do endian conversion where unnecessary, such as for connection id and
  transaction id?

## aquatic_cli_helpers

* Include config field comments in exported toml (likely quite a bit of work)

# Don't do

## aquatic_udp

* Other HashMap hashers (such as SeaHash): seemingly not worthwhile, see
  `https://github.com/tkaitchuck/aHash`
* `sendmmsg`: can't send to multiple socket addresses, so doesn't help
* Config behind Arc in state: it is likely better to be able to pass it around
  without state
* Responses: make vecors iteretor references so we dont have run .collect().
  Doesn't work since it means conversion to bytes must be done while holding
  readable reference to entry in torrent map, hurting concurrency.

## aquatic_udp_protocol

* Use `bytes` crate: seems to worsen performance somewhat
* Zerocopy (https://docs.rs/zerocopy/0.3.0/zerocopy/index.html) for requests
  and responses? Doesn't work on Vec etc
* New array buffer each time in response_to_bytes: doesn't help performance
